English Premier League club Wolves have stopped their players from shopping again with a new variant of coronavirus spreading throughout the country.

Wolves told their players to protect themselves by avoiding trips to the supermarket during the first national lockdown in March.

And Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, who wants the Premier League to introduce twice-weekly COVID-19 tests for players and staff with the virus surging in England, says the club has responded by organising shopping trips for their entire squad.

"We have staff to go shopping and to the supermarkets for them," Nuno said ahead of Sunday's home game with Tottenham.

"We have to avoid any kind of risk because we have a small squad and we have problems with some players out.

"We cannot afford to lose any player, we tell them on a daily basis 'don't relax and try to be more careful'.

"Our kitchen staff puts together a big box of the basic things that we need.

"During the high moment of the pandemic everybody had it. When the situation improved we said to players 'you are free to go and do your own shopping'.

"But now as the levels are increasing so high, and we have this new mutation that everyone is so worried about, we start putting this together again. It's about protecting ourselves.

"We are privileged as professionals in football, so many people take care of us. It's impossible for (the rest of) society, everybody has to take care of themselves."

Asked whether Wolves had taken on extra staff to cope with the situation, Nuno replied: "No. As long as there's goodwill there's no short numbers.

"The kitchen staff, security, everybody helps. We have to stick together, as society, as a club, everybody has to help each other."
